In the tech community there’s a saying: users come for the tool, stay for the network — meaning some platforms start out with tool value and transition into network value. 

It’s actually a really valuable point. I mean, you start by giving something useful to users, they start to use it and interact with each other, building a network. But, **that’s not all**.

As this network expands, you still need to offer users something valuable. Interaction is not enough. These websites need to channel their interaction.Otherwise, users will **get out of you network** and go back to more traditional and/or easier means.

Take Quora as a failed example. They started as a *tool* to have SV ‘celebrities’ to answer your questions. You could at least see their epic responses. That was a highly valuable tool.

Now, it’s flooded with unintelligent brutes asking for the nth way to start their already-failed business. The network has definitely expanded. They got really lucky in India(population!). Too bad they're becoming a completely **worthless community.**

By the way, Quora is not alone. Open your eyes and you will see some legendary animals in the same trend.
