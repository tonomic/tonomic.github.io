What’s behind the name of this blog?
First, it’s the cliché of using (central theme of blog/book) + (nomics). Think about Freakonomics.
So why choosing ‘to’? There are many reasons, but mainly to refer to the preposition ‘to‘. The best word I’ve found to describe ‘purposefulness’, the main driver of modern society.
It's also a good starting point in my criticism.
