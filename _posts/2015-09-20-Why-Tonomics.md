What’s behind the name of this blog?

First, it’s the cliché of using (central theme of blog/book) + (nomics). Think about Freakonomics.

So why choosing ‘to’? There are many reasons, but mainly to refer to the preposition ‘to‘. This is the best word I’ve found to describe ‘purposefulness’, the main driver of progress and decline(_yes_) in modern society.

It's a good starting point in my line of criticism.
