title: Becoming a modern sociopath
---

{{ page.title }}
================

For most of us, the word *sociopath* has an old-fashioned reference: a popular, charismatic and good-looking white male wearing a suit. You'd find them in prestigious jobs yielding power and money: M&A analysts, corporate lawyers, project managers. If you've ever watched *American Psycho*, that's the guy.

These positions still attract many sociopaths, but that's not *what's hot* in the post-2008 world. Instead, the most ingenious, cynic and malicious of them realized this image was actually undermining their careers. So, they pivoted to a more innovative, popular and disruptive image.

Wanna be like them? Here's what you should do:

**1)** Replace your suits for hoodies and startup t-shirts. 


**2)** Keep 'working smart' as you always did. You can throw work at developers and tell them say they're disrupting the world. Cheap and obedient workers.

**3)** Go to some 'disruptive' and 'innovative' hackathons. Free labor for your next startup. Perfect right?

**4)** Read a book called 'Python/JavaScript for dummies'. Although developers will laugh at you, you'll impress dumb investors with words like *Array*, *Data*, *Repository* and, of course, *Disruption*.

**5)** Buy whatever you want, even if extremely expensive. It's all about 'making employees feel cozy', 'impressing customers' and 'awesome SoMa experience'. 

**6)** Don't say you chose a frat buddy over a more qualified applicant. It's all about cultural fit.

**7)** **Publicly** give yourself a small salary of $80-150k. Don't worry! You can still use corporate credit cards for 'dinner with clients' or 'night out with PM'.

**8)** If you can't make a penny, don't worry. Again, use the words 'scaling', 'disruption', 'innovation' and your investors will call you a genius. They'll probably give you more money. 

**9)** Work on PR and Marketing 24/7. Inflate your company like crazy. Shareholders of corporations will see you as competition. **You** will be acquired. **You** will make millions/billions.

**10)** So, your employees got screwed in the acquisition? Whatever, you're not an sociopathic asshole anymore. You have *Asperger's Syndrome*
